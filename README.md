# ERDDAP Timeseries Explorer

Idea is to make a simple, interactive ERDDAP time series viewer in a notebook using Jupyter widgets

- do a query to find the lon,lat points of all time series stations that contain a specified `standard_name` variable
- put station markers on a map 
- click a station and get a time series plot from the last two weeks of data 
- select a different `standard_name` variable from a drop down menu
